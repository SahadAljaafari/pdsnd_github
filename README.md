>**Note**: Please **fork** the current Udacity repository so that you will have a **remote** repository in **your** Github account. Clone the remote repository to your local machine. Later, as a part of the project "Post your Work on Github", you will push your proposed changes to the remote repository in your Github account.

### Project Title
Github Project

### Description
This project is focused on getting familiar with GitHub and Git commands. The goal is to learn how to:

-Clone a repository from GitHub
-Add files to the repository
-Commit changes to the repository
-Push the changes to a remote GitHub repository
-Create a new branch 

### Files used
The project utilizes the Bikeshare.py script along with three data files: washington.csv, new_york_city.csv, and chicago.csv.


###Credits
The project is inspired by the Udacity repository on GitHub, which was used as a reference for this hands-on project.

The original Udacity repository can be found here: Udacity Repository Link.

###Lessons Learned
Throughout this project, I gained deeper insights into the following Git and GitHub concepts:
Managing local and remote repositories.
Understanding the significance of .gitignore files to keep unwanted files out of version control.
Navigating branches to separate different workstreams and experiment with new features safely.
